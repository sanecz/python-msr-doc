msr:
- value: 33H
  name: TEST_CTRL
  bitfields:
  - bit: '28:0'
    description: Reserved
  - bit: '29'
    access: '0'
    long_description: 'Enable #AC exception for split locked accesses: Cause #AC exception for split locked access at all CPL irrespective of CR0.AM or EFLAGS.AC. If bits 29 and 31 are both set, bit 29 takes precedence.'
    description: 'Enable #AC exception for split locked accesses'
  - bit: '30'
    description: Reserved
  - bit: '31'
    description: Disable LOCK# assertion for split locked access
  scope: Core
  description: Test Control Register
- value: 329H
  name: MSR_PERF_METRICS
  bitfields:
  - bit: '7:0'
    description: Retiring
  - bit: '15:8'
    description: Bad Speculation
  - bit: '23:16'
    description: Frontend Bound
  - bit: '31:24'
    description: Backend Bound
  - bit: '63:25'
    description: Reserved
  scope: Thread
  access: R/W
  description: Performance Metrics
  long_description: Performance Metrics Reports metrics directly. Software can check (and/or expose to its guests) the availability of PERF_METRICS feature using IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES.PERF_METRICS_AVAILABL E (bit 15).
- value: 3F2H
  name: MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG
  bitfields:
  - bit: '0'
    long_description: Memory Info. Setting this bit will capture memory information such as the linear address, data source and latency of the memory access in the PEBS record.
    description: Memory Info
  - bit: '1'
    long_description: GPRs. Setting this bit will capture the contents of the General Purpose registers in the PEBS record.
    description: GPRs
  - bit: '2'
    long_description: XMMs. Setting this bit will capture the contents of the XMM registers in the PEBS record.
    description: XMMs
  - bit: '3'
    long_description: LBRs. Setting this bit will capture LBR TO, FROM and INFO in the PEBS record.
    description: LBRs
  - bit: '23:4'
    description: Reserved
  - bit: '31:24'
    long_description: LBR Entries. Set the field to the desired number of entries - 1. For example, if the LBR_entries field is 0, a single entry will be included in the record. To include 32 LBR entries, set the LBR_entries field to 31 (0x1F). To ensure all PEBS records are 16-byte aligned, software can use LBR_entries that is multiple of 3.

  scope: Thread
  access: R/W
  description: PEBS Data Configuration
  long_description: PEBS Data Configuration Provides software the capability to select data groups of interest and thus reduce the record size in memory and record generation latency. Hence, a PEBS record's size and layout vary based on the selected groups. The MSR also allows software to select LBR depth for branch data records.
