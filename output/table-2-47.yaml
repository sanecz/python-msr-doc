- value: D10H-D17H
  name: IA32_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-7]
  bitfields:
  - bit: '19:0'
    long_description: 'WAYS_MASK Setting a 1 in this bit X allows threads with CLOS <n> (where N is [0-7]) to allocate to way X in the MLC. Ones are only allowed to be written to ways that physically exist in the MLC (CPUID.4.2:EBX[31:22] will indicate this). Writing a 1 to a value beyond the highest way or a non-contiguous set of 1s will cause a #GP on the WRMSR to this MSR.'
