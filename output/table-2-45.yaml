    description: Reserved
  - bit: '2'
    description: FUSA_SUPPORTED
  - bit: '3'
    long_description: RSM_IN_CPL0_ONLY When set to 1, the RSM instruction is only allowed in CPL0 (#GP triggered in any CPL != 0). When set to 0, then any CPL may execute the RSM instruction.
    description: RSM_IN_CPL0_ONLY
  - bit: '4'
    description: Reserved
  - bit: '5'
    long_description: 'SPLIT_LOCK_DISABLE_SUPPORTED When set to 1, the ability to set MEMORY_CONTROL (MSR 33H) bit 29 enables an #AC to be created when a split lock is detected.'

  description: IA32 Core Capabilities Register
  long_description: IA32 Core Capabilities Register If CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0):EDX[30] = 1. This MSR provides an architectural enumeration function for model-specific behavior.

  name: IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3
  bitfields:
  - bit: '0'
    long_description: LOADIWKEY This control determines whether executions of LOADIWKEY cause VM exits.
    description: LOADIWKEY
  - bit: '63:1'
    description: Reserved
  scope: Core
  description: IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3
  long_description: IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3 This MSR enumerates the allowed 1-settings of the third set of processor-based controls. Specifically, VM entry allows bit X of the tertiary processor-based VM- execution controls to be 1 if and only if bit X of the MSR is set to 1. If bit X of the MSR is cleared to 0, VM entry fails if control X and the “activate tertiary controls” primary processor-based VM-execution control are both 1.
- value: 601H
  name: MSR_VR_CURRENT_CONFIG
  bitfields:
  - bit: '12:0'
    long_description: PL4 Value PL4 value in 0.125 A increments. This field is locked by VR_CURRENT_CONFIG[LOCK]. When the LOCK bit is set to 1b, this field becomes Read Only.
    description: PL4 Value
  - bit: '30:13'
    description: Reserved
  - bit: '31'
    access: LOCK
    long_description: Lock Indication This bit will lock the CURRENT_LIMIT settings in this register and will also lock this setting. This means that once set to 1b, the CURRENT_LIMIT setting and this bit become Read Only until the next Warm Reset.
    description: Lock Indication
  - bit: '62:32'
    description: Not in use.
  - bit: '63'

  bitfields:
  - bit: '19:0'
    long_description: 'WAYS_MASK Setting a 1 in this bit X allows threads with CLOS <n> (where N is [0-7]) to allocate to way X in the MLC. Ones are only allowed to be written to ways that physically exist in the MLC (CPUID.4.2:EBX[31:22] will indicate this). Writing a 1 to a value beyond the highest way or a non-contiguous set of 1s will cause a #GP on the WRMSR to this MSR.'
