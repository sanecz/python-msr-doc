    description: Reserved Reserved for future extension of CountWindow.
  - bit: '39:32'
    long_description: Count0 The current value of counter 0 updated after each occurrence of the event being counted. The count value is frozen on a valid branch monitoring triggering condition (in which case CntrHit0 will also be set). This is an 8-bit signed value (2’s complement). Heuristic events which only increment will saturate and freeze at maximum value 0xFF (256). RET-CALL event counter saturate at maximum value 0x7F (+127) and minimum value 0x80 (-128).

The counter is updated only after a core C state exit. Note: Always reads 0 if core C1 is unsupported. A value of zero indicates that this processor does not support core C1 or never entered core C1 level state.'
