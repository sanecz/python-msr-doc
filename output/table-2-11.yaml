    long_description: LVL_2 Base Address Specifies the base address visible to software for IO redirection. If IO MWAIT Redirection is enabled, reads to this address will be consumed by the power management logic and decoded to MWAIT instructions. When IO port address redirection is enabled, this is the IO port address reported to the OS/software.
