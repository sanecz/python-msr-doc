  long_description: See Section 16.3.2.3, “IA32_MCi_ADDR MSRs.” The MSR_MC3_ADDR register is either not implemented or contains no address if the ADDRV flag in the MSR_MC3_STATUS register is clear. When not implemented in the processor, all reads and writes to this MSR will cause a general-protection exception.
