When this bit is clear (0, default), the processor does not change the VID signals or the bus to core ratio when the processor enters a thermal managed state. If the TM2 feature flag (ECX[8]) is not set to 1 after executing CPUID with EAX = 1, then this feature is not supported and BIOS must not alter the contents of this bit location.
