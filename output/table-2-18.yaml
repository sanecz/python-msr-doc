    long_description: 'AES Configuration Upon a successful read of this MSR, the configuration of AES instruction set availability is as follows: 11b: AES instructions are not available until next RESET. Otherwise, AES instructions are available. Note, AES instruction set is not available if read is unsuccessful. If the configuration is not 01b, AES instructions can be mis-configured if a privileged agent unintentionally writes 11b.'
